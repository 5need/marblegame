# marble ideas

- Death ball
  On contact: destroys other marble and itself
- Lock ball
  On contact: locks position of other marble and itself
- Glass ball
  2x whole score, breaks after 2 collisions
- Multi-ball
  3 small balls in one, each score 1/3
- Return ball
  On contact: return other ball to owner's hand
- d20
  Lands on a side and adds that to score
- Super position
  On contact: switch places with other ball
- Obsidian ball
  Breaks on contact, huge mass
- Ball bearing
  Low friction, big mass
- Spy ball
  Changes owner when hit
- Goof ball
  Scores nothing lol, has very low mass

# game ideas

- game starts out with a spy ball in the center with no owner
- maybe hide normal scoring, and only show a +100 in the center or 2x on balls that do that
- mechanic for ricochet-ing off the walls of the arena
